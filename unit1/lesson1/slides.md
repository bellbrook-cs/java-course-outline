# Welcome to Intro to Java! <!--fit-->

## Part 1

Open the link to repl.it on google classroom before we begin.

https://repl.it/github/bellbrook-cs/java-lesson1-starter-code

Try clicking the `run` button.

## Part 2

Work with your table to figure out how this program works. 

Modify the code to print:

```
Hello World!
```

## Part 3

A rem or remark is something that doesn't actually change the way your program runs, but tells the human reader of your program something important.

```java
// Programmer: Kosmo Kramer
// Date created: Sept 34, 1492
// School: Charles Manson High School; Berkley, Ca
```

```java
/*  Programmer: Kosmo Kramer
    Date created: Sept 34, 1492
    School: Charles Manson High School; Berkley, Ca     */
```

## Do Now

<!-- _class: lead -->

Work through parts **3-7** with your table.

We'll reconvene to discuss what we learned at the end of class.

Raise your hand if you have any questions.

## `print` vs `println`

What is the difference?

What did your group notice?

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Hello");
        System.out.println("World!");
    }
}
```

## Other `println`s

What did your group notice?

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.");
        System.out.println("I like computer science");
        System.out.println(25 / 5);
        System.out.println(4 / 7.0445902);
        System.out.println(13 * 159.56);
    }
}
```
